If you're familiar with JFrog Artifactory - our universal binary repository manager - JFrog Container Registry is a free and lightweight solution for Helm and Docker repositories. It offers an end-to-end solution covering the full lifecycle of your Docker and Helm registry allowing you to manage development, vulnerability analysis, artifact flow control and distribution.

The solution was developed with the community in mind and we're excited to be providing features from our enterprise-level solutions directly in our Container Registry platform to the everyday developer. It includes full automation capabilities with REST API and the JFrog CLI. 

JFrog Container Registry is free for self-hosted installations. You can also host it on the cloud with JFrog.

To learn more about these features and create multiple Helm and Docker repositories for your work with HelmCenter, visit our [download page for JFrog Container Registry](https://jfrog.com/download-jfrog-container-registry/) today.
